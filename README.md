# dataModel.S4BLDG

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Actuator](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/Actuator/README.md). An actuator is a mechanical device for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. An actuator takes energy, usually created by air, electricity, or liquid, and converts that into some kind of motion.

- [AirToAirHeatRecovery](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/AirToAirHeatRecovery/README.md). An air-to-air heat recovery device employs a counter-flow heat exchanger between inbound and outbound air flow. It is typically used to transfer heat from warmer air in one chamber to cooler air in the second chamber (i.e., typically used to recover heat from the conditioned air being exhausted and the outside air being supplied to a building), resulting in energy savings from reduced heating (or cooling) requirements.

- [Alarm](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/Alarm/README.md). An alarm is a device that signals the existence of a condition or situation that is outside the boundaries of normal expectation or that activates such a device.  Alarms include the provision of break glass buttons and manual pull boxes that are used to activate alarms.

- [AudioVisualAppliance](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/AudioVisualAppliance/README.md). An audio-visual appliance is a device that displays, captures, transmits, or receives audio or video.  Audio-visual appliances may be fixed in place or may be able to be moved from one space to another. They may require an electrical supply that may be supplied either by an electrical circuit or provided from a local battery source. Audio-visual appliances may be connected to data circuits including specialist circuits for audio visual purposes only.

- [Boiler](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/Boiler/README.md). A boiler is a closed, pressure-rated vessel in which water or other fluid is heated using an energy source such as natural gas, heating oil, or electricity. The fluid in the vessel is then circulated out of the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications.

A coil may be used either for heating or cooling purposes by placing a series of tubes (the coil) carrying a heating or cooling fluid into an airstream. The coil may be constructed from tubes bundled in a serpentine form or from finned tubes that give a extended heat transfer surface.  Coils may also be used for non-airflow cases such as embedded in a floor slab.

A cooled beam (or chilled beam) is a device typically used to cool air by circulating a fluid such as chilled water through exposed finned tubes above a space. Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again.

- [CoolingTower](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/CoolingTower/README.md). A cooling tower is a device which rejects heat to ambient air by circulating a fluid such as water through it to reduce its temperature by partial evaporation.

Power outlets are commonly connected within a junction box; data outlets may be directly connected to a wall. For power outlets sharing the same circuit within a junction box, the ports should indicate the logical wiring relationship to the enclosing junction box, even though they may be physically connected to a cable going to another outlet, switch, or fixture.

- [ProtectiveDevice](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/ProtectiveDevice/README.md). A protective device breaks an electrical circuit when a stated electric current that passes through it is exceeded.

It may be used to represent the complete set of elements including both the tripping unit and the breaking unit that provide the protection. This may be particularly useful at earlier stages of design where the approach to breaking the electrical supply may be determined but the method of tripping may not.
