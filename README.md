### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Actuator](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/Actuator/README.md). An actuator is a mechanical device for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. An actuator takes energy, usually created by air, electricity, or liquid, and converts that into some kind of motion.

- [AirToAirHeatRecovery](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/AirToAirHeatRecovery/README.md). An air-to-air heat recovery device employs a counter-flow heat exchanger between inbound and outbound air flow. It is typically used to transfer heat from warmer air in one chamber to cooler air in the second chamber (i.e., typically used to recover heat from the conditioned air being exhausted and the outside air being supplied to a building), resulting in energy savings from reduced heating (or cooling) requirements.

- [Alarm](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.S4BLDG/blob/master/Alarm/README.md). An alarm is a device that signals the existence of a condition or situation that is outside the boundaries of normal expectation or that activates such a device.  Alarms include the provision of break glass buttons and manual pull boxes that are used to activate alarms.
